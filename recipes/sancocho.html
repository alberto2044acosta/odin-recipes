        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Now you are going to see a very particular kind of food (probably you have eaten something similar before): 
            Sancocho. This food is like soup, but in some way bigger, because it has more ingredients, making it
            delicious. Similar to other Dominican recipes, sancocho was made in the colonial era. Along the years it
            has evolved in many different ways, because there is not only one way to cook it.</p>

        <p>Before I said that sancocho is similar to soup, and that it has more ingredients, but what are those
            ingredients? How does a normal sancocho look like? Let's see that now:</p>

        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Soup broth</li>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Pork chop</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Corn</li>
            <li>Cassava</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Steps (because of the nature of the recipe, it's like put different foods together, so for example 
            we can cook first the chicken and then the corn or viceversa. Anyway, I will put a list so that it is
            easier to cook):</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>The first step is to make the soup broth</li>
            <li>The second step is to cook the chicken</li>
            <li>The third step is cook the pork chop</li>
            <li>The fourth step is cook the rice</li>
            <li>The fifth step is cook the corn</li>
            <li>The sixth step is cook the cassava</li>
            <li>The seventh step is put all together</li>
        </ol>
